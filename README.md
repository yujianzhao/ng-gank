## TODO
- [x] Toast Notification
- [x] Menu Icons
- [ ] Custom loading module (replace angular2-busy)
- [ ] Archiving and caching posts using PouchDB
- [ ] Scroll down refreshing (for new posts) and load cached posts
- [ ] Photo viewer module
- [ ] Github Auth, comments, and likes (this will need a back-end storage and might as well integrate with PouchDB)
- [ ] Multi-language support?
